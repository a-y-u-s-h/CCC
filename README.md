# Discoveries
This repository holds my creations in C++ based creative coding platforms like `Openframeworks`, `Cinder`, etc. I started with `Experiments in JS` series, which is cool : allows me to share cool things to masses really quickly with just one link. 

But sometimes I require much more performance from hardware which is possible from slightly lower level langauges like C++, C, etc. This series is named `discoveries` because..I don't know what I'll learn as I make things!
